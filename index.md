### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my favorite labs because it was our first lab and it was basically us learning the basics. We were just learning how to code and to complete these labs for the upcoming labs. 

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was my favorite because for part 2 we were coding about blackjack especially because I don't play much card games and rarely know much about blackjack. Through the labs I was able to learn something about blackjack.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 was my favorite because while doing the labs I was able to pick up on stuff about the olympic scoring. I was able to learn on writing the minimums and maximums of the scores.
